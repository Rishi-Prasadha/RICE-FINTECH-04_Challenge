# Whale Fund Analysis App

This application was created to calculate and analyze the profits/performance of so called "whales," compared to the performance of the market (S&P 500). Particularly we are looking into Soros Fund Management LLC, Paulson & Co.Inc., Tiger Global Management, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Based on these analysis, we decide which fund offers the most return with the least risk to investors.

## Technologies
